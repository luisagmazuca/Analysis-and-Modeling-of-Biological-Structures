Analysis and Modeling of Biological Structures

hwk4 = reads a TSV file and counts how many GPCRs belong to each of the main family groups under the GRAFS classification system. Using Matplotlib, it creates a pie chart to display the GRAFS family classification for the human GPCRs in the database. 

hwk5 = this script calculates the average KD hydrophobicity score across a window of amino acids from a protein sequence. It takes a file containing an amino acid sequence in FASTA format, along with the window length and start position as input. The output is the average hydrophobicity score across the specified window. It can aslso calculate the moving KD score average for a window of fixed length (that is adjustable) and moves along the protein with a set step size (adjustable too).

hwk6 = is a modified python script hwk5, it can read in and process multiple sequences in a FASTA file to produce a list of moving averages of KD scores for each sequence. It graphs the moving average of KD scores in each sequence using Matplotlib.
